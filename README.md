# BARRA_risk
A risk evaluation program that follows BARRA's CNE6 and USE4 risk model to predict the risk and distribution of factors in a portfolio. 
Created by Rosemary He Sept. 2019, under Zhiqiang Zhang.
This is the culminating project for my internship at Franklin Templeton Sealand Fund Management for from fall 2019 to winter 2020.
